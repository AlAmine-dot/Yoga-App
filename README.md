# Yoga-App
Yoga App is a mini Daily Yoga Routine planner where you can create a specific routine of Yoga/Stretching positions, add, delete, sort and set a timer for each of them.
Once the routine completely put down, you can start it and the application will automatically time everything up and trigger a ring bell to help you follow the routine
properly.
